The Design Thinking project was a valuable learning experience that taught me the importance of creative problem-solving and user-centered approaches.
From empathizing with users to prototyping and testing, each step helped me understand how to address real-world challenges effectively.
One of the key lessons was the importance of teamwork and collaboration.
Working with my team to brainstorm ideas and refine our solutions helped me see how diverse perspectives contribute to better outcomes. 
I also learned to embrace feedback and view it as an opportunity to improve our designs.
